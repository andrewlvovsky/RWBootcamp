## Packaging Seed Data

In this project, we use JSON to package and import the seed sandwich data when the app is first started. Another option for packaging could be the use of property lists. Howeever, due to its ease of readability and portability, it makes more sense to use JSON for this project in particular. If the packaged objects had less attributes, then maybe the using property lists would be nice here.
